MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio add-in for WakaTime
==============================================

WakaTime is a productivity & time tracking tool for programmers. Once the WakaTime plugin is installed, you get a dashboard with reports about your programming by time, language, project, and branch.

Installation
------------

Heads Up! WakaTime depends on [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/) being installed to work correctly.

1. Inside Visual Studio, navigate to `Tools` -> `Add-in Manager`

2. Click the `Gallery` tab, then search for `wakatime`.

3. Click the `Install` button and then when add-in installation dialog popups click `Install`.

4. On MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio versions prior to 5.10 you might get an error message, just ignore it, it's a Mono.Addin bug, it has been already solved in latest releases.

3. Enter your [api key](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey) from [https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey), then press `Appy`.

4. Use Visual Studio like you normally do and your time will be tracked for you automatically.

5. Visit https://wakatime.com to see your logged time.
